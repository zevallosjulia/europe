      <h2>Visiting the Peak of Harder Kulm</h2>
      <h3>May 2017</h3>
      <strong class="opening-line">This is a beautiful Lookout (4337 feet above the sea level).</strong>

      <p>Harder Kulm is one of the Interlaken's greater attractions. It is located between the Lakes of Brienz and Thun. Interlaken means in between lakes indeed.</p>

      <p>The Harder Kulm is the closest mountain to the city of Interlaken, the real reason to visit the place is the panorama over the entire Luetschine Valley, with the Lakes and the summits of the Eiger, Moench and Jungfraujoch from up there.  Transportation is provided by a local funicular that was built about a century ago, the ride only lasts 10 minutes.</p>

    <p>From the upper station there is a five-minute walk that takes you to the Harder Kulm Restaurant. It is like a little castle with red tile roof and a mini turret.</p>
